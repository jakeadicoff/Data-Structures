Code from intro data structures (freshman spring).

lab 1: Learning C, implement selection sort with pointers.
lab 2: Linked lists, implement a simple address book.
lab 3: OOP in c++, simple example project
lab 4: c++ vectors, solve a word search board. Also implement binary search.
lab 5: Recursion, find all words in a boggle board.
lab 6: Stacks, implement a solver for Sudoku.
lab 7: Hashtables, make a hashtable and hash 'gameboard' values.

I did not write the make for these assignments, and have not looked at the projects a couple of years -- they may not run (but they used to!).
